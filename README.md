# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Project

This repository contains scripts for analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

## Contents

- **Data Collection**: A Python script that collects social media data from platforms like Twitter using APIs.
- **Data Preprocessing**: A Python script that cleans the collected data, including text normalization, removal of stopwords, and tokenization.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: A Python script that performs sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, categorizing the text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Visualization**: A Python script that visualizes the sentiment patterns over time or across different topics or brands using charts and graphs.
